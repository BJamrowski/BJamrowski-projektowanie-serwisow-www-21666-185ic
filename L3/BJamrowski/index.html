            <div class="akapit1">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Norse mythology, Skaði (/ˈskɑːði/, sometimes anglicized
                as
                Skadi, Skade, or Skathi) is a
                jötunn and goddess associated with bowhunting, skiing, winter, and mountains. Skaði is attested in the
                Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the Prose Edda and in
                Heimskringla, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, and in the works of skalds.

            <div class="akapit2"><br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Skaði is the daughter of the deceased Þjazi, and Skaði
                married the god
                Njörðr as part of the
                compensation
                provided by the gods for killing her father Þjazi. In Heimskringla, Skaði is described as having split
                up
                with Njörðr and as later having married the god Odin, and that the two produced many children together.
                In
                both the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda, Skaði is responsible for placing the serpent that drips venom
                onto
                the bound Loki. Skaði is alternately referred to as Öndurguð (Old Norse 'ski god') and Öndurdís (Old
                Norse
                'ski dís').

            <div class="akapit3"><br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The etymology of the name Skaði is uncertain, but may
                be connected
                with the original form of
                Scandinavia.
                Some place names in Scandinavia refer to Skaði. Scholars have theorized a potential connection between
                Skaði
                and the god Ullr (who is also associated with skiing), a particular relationship with the jötunn Loki,
                and
                that Scandinavia may be related to the name Skaði (potentially meaning 'Skaði's island') or the name may
                be
                connected to an Old Norse noun meaning 'harm'. Skaði has inspired various works of art.
